    <p> <strong>Hello world. This is a website for the underdog, the everyday person who is going from being a couch potato to a medal hog.
                I want to first be able to share with you my story and my fitness journey in progress. Then my training tips, and finally 
                my race reports that I have been able to complete, and my goals for this next year. Thanks for stopping by!
            </strong> </p>

<h2 class="story"> My Story </h2>
<div>
    <p> I was on the city bus from a doctor's apt for a work accident when the city bus wrecked. It could have been worse, but I 
        had whiplash throughout my spine and I was unable to run for four months. 
        I had a back brace and physical therapy with chiropractic four times a week.</p>

    <p>I was in pain and I turned to food as a comfort instead of as a fuel ( If you get stuck in that mental space then I will 
        bring that formula later in my blog). As you can see there, I had a big stack of pancakes. I ate like a runner, even when 
        I wasn't a runner and it caught up to me.</p>
    
    <p>It was hard to get out of that mental funk, when there was so much I felt like I couldn't do and that first mile made all the difference.
    
    Then in January that following year they thought that I had a heart issue because my EKG 'as abnormal. 
    
    I was at an all time low. I was not able to do ANY cardio activity and I was nervous as hell that something was wrong with my heart and 
    turns out after seeing a cardiologist that they gave me a clean bill of health</p>
    
    <p>Then I thought to myself
    
    <strong> "Whats my excuse?"</strong></p> 

    <p> So I trained hard and completed my first half marathon in spring of 2016. I did a second half in the fall that year. I was at the 
        finisher party for the IronMan Louisville and then was when I thought " This is my next big goal. This is what I was meant to do". 
        That was the start of my journey. Thank you for listening and I hope you will be here along with me as I continue my journey.</p>

    <h2 class="training_tips">Training Basics- So what do you need anyway?</h2>          
    <div>
        <p>Give him a friend, we forget the trees get lonely too. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first. Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. Mountains are so simple, they're hard. You create the dream - then you bring it into your world.</p>

        <p>You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important. Let your heart be your guide. I get carried away with this brush cleaning. There comes a nice little fluffer.</p>
        
        <p>You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. Let's build an almighty mountain. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way. We'll play with clouds today. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush. How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day.</p>
        
        <p>In your world you can create anything you desire. It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. All kinds of happy little splashes. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better.</p>
        
        <p>A big strong tree needs big strong roots. And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen. The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start. A beautiful little sunset. 
            If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them. Do an almighty painting with us.</p>
        
        <p>Just a little indication. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. Anyone can paint. Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world. A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play.</p>
        
        <p>You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun.</p>

<h2 class= "race_day_tips"> How to put your best self forward on Race Day!! </h2>
<div>
    <p> First off, you need to consider fueling strategies for up to three days prior to your event. The other piece is considering how much carbs, fat, protein, fiber, and hydration you are used to eating and what you need to eat. </p>
    
    <p>Based on my own experience, I know for a fact that the food you eat for a sprint look significantly different than that for a IronMan 70.3 for example:</p>
    
    <p> Perhaps you refer to the imminent attack of your Rebel fleet. Yes...I assure you we are quite safe from your friends here. Your overconfidence is your weakness. Your faith in your friends is yours. It is pointless to resist, my son. 
        Everything that has transpired has done so according to my design. Your friends up there on the Sanctuary Moon are walking into a trap. As is your Rebel fleet! It was I who allowed the Alliance to know the location of the shield generator. 
        
    <p>It is quite safe from your pitiful little band. An entire legion of my best troops awaits them. 
        Oh...I'm afraid the deflector shield will be quite operational when your friends arrive.</p>

        <p> Hey, you're not permitted in there. It's restricted. You'll be deactivated for sure.. Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease! Now come out before somebody sees you. Secret mission? What plans? What are you talking about? 
            I'm not getting in there! I'm going to regret this. There goes another one. Hold your fire. There are no life forms. It must have been short-circuited. That's funny, the damage doesn't look as bad from out here. Are you sure this things safe? </p>

            <p>You're safe! We had feared the worst. When we heard about Alderaan, we were afraid that you were... We don't have time for our sorrows, Commander. The battle station has surely tracked us here. It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape. 
                You must use the information in this R2 unit to plan the attack. It is our only hope. Yes. We are approaching the planet Yavin. The Rebel base is on a moon on the far side. We are preparing to orbit the planet.
            </p>   
            <p>Luke? Lord Vader has set a trap for him. And we're the bait. Well, he's on his way. Perfect. You fixed us all pretty good, didn't you? My friend! Stop! I've done all I can do. I'm sorry I couldn't do better, but I have my own problems. Yeah, you're a real hero. You certainly have a way with people.

                    Run! Yes. A Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware of the dark side. Anger...fear...aggression. The dark side of the Force are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight. If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it 
                    did Obi-Wan's apprentice. Vader. Is the dark side stronger? No...no...no. Quicker, easier, more seductive. But how am I to know the good side from the bad? You will know. When you are calm, at peace. Passive. A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack. But tell me why 
                    I can't... No, no, there is no why. Nothing more will I teach you today. Clear your mind of questions. Mmm. Mmmmmm.</p>

                What is thy bidding, my master? There is a great disturbance in the Force. I have felt it. We have a new enemy - Luke Skywalker. Yes, my master. He could destroy us. He's just a boy. 
                Obi-Wan can no longer help him. The Force is strong with him. 
                The son of Skywalker must not become a Jedi. If he could be turned, he would become a powerful ally. Yes. Yes. He would be a great asset. Can it be done? He will join us or die, my master.</p>

                <p> Bespin. It's pretty far, but I think we can make it. A mining colony? Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine. Lando conned somebody out of it. We go back a long way, Lando and me. Can you trust him? No. 
                But he has no love for the Empire, I can tell you that. Here we go, Chewie. Stand by. Detach! You do have your moments. Not many, but you have them.</p>

        The illustrious Jabba bids you welcome and will gladly pay you the reward of twenty-five thousand. I want fifty thousand. No less. Uh, oh... but what, what did I say? Uh, the mighty Jabba asks why he must pay fifty thousand. 
        Because he's holding a thermal detonator. This bounty hunter is my kind of scum. Fearless and inventive. Jabba offers the sum of thirty-five. And I suggest you take it. Zeebuss. He agrees! Just relax for a moment.</p> 

    <p>Oh, General Solo, somebody's coming. Oh! Luke! Where's Leia? What? She didn't come back? I thought she was with you. We got separated. Hey, we better go look for her. Take the squad ahead. We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.

    <div><p><strong><i> Number Two: IronMan 70.3 Muncie </i> </strong></p></div> 

   <p>OK. I know it’s been a severely delayed race report, but I needed processing time for my first attempt at a half-IronMan. I am still in awe of what I was able to accomplish that day; I shouldn’t have been able to do it, going from not being able to walk post auto accident two years ago to registering for 
       an Iron Distance race. I felt embarrassed because I saw everyone else’s gleaming PR finishes on the forum, and I had a DNF for the race I had trained like crazy for, for five months. 
        I’ve had enough time for reflection, so I feel that I am just now able to look at the positives.</p> 
       <p> Day before the race we had been driving around all over the back side of prairie creek reservoir for an hour, trying to find the registration area and when we finally got there to not miss the race briefing, the weather turned ugly. Quick. Hail, wind gusts, and freezing rain in July made my run back
            to the car pretty miserable. Bike check in even closed down and the IM village area closed two hours early. Still, I got my backpack, my luggage tag, t-shirt ( which clung a whole lot more to my body than I wanted) and my latex free swim cap (YAY allergy awareness!!). I felt like I had been a carb monster (cue the pretzels)
             and that I was ready for anything.</p>
      <div> <p>Finally found our hotel room in Anderson and realized there was several other people in that hotel for the same race as me. I didn’t feel so alone. My husband has a machine for sleep apnea and he forgot it 😱 so my rest the day before wasn’t restful at all. The crazy thing is, I was excited, lubed generously for my tri-kit, 
        and felt pretty great warming up in the reservoir. 
    </section>
    <section class="swim_12">
        <div class="swim"><p><strong>The Swim</strong></p></div>
        When my swim wave started, everyone else swam much quicker than I did. Those seconds where I slowly became the last one, the slowest swimmer in my age group felt like an eternity.
        I had people on kayaks instantly asking me if I was okay. I felt disoriented trying to swim straight from the current, and feeling like I couldn’t breathe. I feel that the water was choppier from the storm the previous day, and when the waves of other swimmers hit, every five minutes, I had one person kick me in the ribs, pull my legs, and drag me below the water.
         I felt like I was drowning and I don’t know why that swimmer wasn’t given a penalty for that. I TANKED. BAD. I did not expect after fighting off that wave that I would feel as if I hadn’t eaten all day. All those carbs, all that carb loading, and I still felt exhausted. I wasn’t aware that asking for the boat meant they would take away my timing chip. So because 
         of the current, waves of aggressive swimmers, and my energy tanking, I made the call to get help. It was the hardest call that I had ever made, saying that I couldn’t do something. It was a smart call of course, but I balled like a baby. </p>
        <p>Then one staff in the boat whispered to me “Go ahead, do the rest of the course, see what you can do out there. You’ve came this far don’t quit” My husband was waiting for me on the other side of transition and we found a race official together and explained what happened. I was allowed to continue the rest of the course.
     </section>

    <section class="bike_56">
            <div class="bike"><p><strong>The Bike</strong></p></div>
            I had my infinit drink mix, and nothing to mix it with, so it was pretty much water, and I used the Gatorade and other course nutrition. Right at the mount/dismount line for the bike, I fell off my bike and my chain came off. No one could help me (but they didn’t know I had a DNF for my swim). Proudly I fixed it myself. Some hills they said. 
        Great course they said. It was 56 miles of ROLLING HILLS. My quads saved the day (love dem babies), because I had never biked hills like THOSE before. I felt accomplished for doing what I could. Right around mile 40 I heard this weird new sound from my black beauty, and turns out my front disc brake was loose. The sound stopped, she sounded normal again, 
        and it was worth waiting ten minutes for tech support, because if something happened going downhill, it could have been very ugly. I had this badass moment where I didn't slow down, and I pitched my empty gatorade bottle into a trash can on my bike and MADE IT. 🤣</p>
    </div>  
    <div>
       <p> My $%% felt like it was on fire, and even when I reapplied my chamois butter, it still hurt. I would move around in my saddle, sing pop songs in my head, anything to get me just one mile closer. I cried when I saw the transition area, that blessed “dismount line” sign. I felt like I couldn’t walk another step, much less run. But I MADE THE CUTOFF TIME!!! I was soo 
        happy that my biking was on par. I felt slowly like this would turn into a success. 
    </section>
    <section class="run_131">
       <div class="run"><p><strong>The run and the finish</strong></p></div>
        Easy run they said. Only two hills they said. Cue my quads of steel once more and my Garmin. I did a run/walk and I am glad that I did. I must have burned through all of my calories, because it wasn’t until mile 9 that I had to use the bathroom at all. I used every aid station, put ice in my hat, and right around mile 4/9 was the most energetic volunteer/aid station. 
        They made me feel like a rockstar. It reminded me that I was doing something above average. At one point a volunteer said “You triathletes are beasts!” #allthefeels. About mile 11 I ran into a very friendly lady, Nuvia) who once I showed her my nails, she asked If I was a member of women for tri because she liked my nails. Such a small world after all, and to be a part 
        of such a vast community. I got to have a women for tri meet up after all. </p>
       <p> My hamstrings were killing me and she had bad stomach cramps, so we walked together. We stopped to help an athlete who had fallen and twisted her ankle until medical staff arrived. I knew my times for the run didn’t matter. I’m glad that I was able to help and that we all were able to cross the finish line. I set my hat down 200 meters before the finish chute and when I saw that chute, I just flew. 
        I ran and I was soo happy that I swam .4 miles, biked 56 and ran 13.1. I gave it my all and when I found my husband and after my high fives, I had some awesome potatoes and veggie burgers. I wanted to cry, but I felt relief, I felt like I didn’t give up, even when they took away my timing chip. But I am proud of the journey it took to get me there. And my recovery weight gain is going back down!! 
        I am proud of the 35 pounds I lost on this journey. That I didn’t listen to all of the family members who thought I was doing more harm than good by training for this. I’m glad I didn’t listen to the voice that told me I wasn’t ready to tri. I will become an IronMan. I have also decided to do this race next year, and I’ll give those currents a run for their money. And no matter the pain, no matter, 
        the difficulty, always smile for the camera guy ;)</p>
