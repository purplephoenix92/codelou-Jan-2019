    <h1>Transformidable- <i>Advice for the everyday Triathlete</i></h1>
    <p> <strong>Hello world. This is a website for the underdog, the everyday person who is going from being a couch potato to a medal hog.
                I want to first be able to share with you my story and my fitness journey in progress. Then my training tips, and finally 
                my race reports that I have been able to complete, and my goals for this next year. Thanks for stopping by!
            </strong> </p>
                
    <h2 class="story"> My Story </h2>
    <div>
       <p> I was on the city bus from a doctor's apt for a work accident when the city bus wrecked. It could have been worse, but I 
           had whiplash throughout my spine and I was unable to run for four months. 
           I had a back brace and physical therapy with chiropractic four times a week.</p>

       <p>I was in pain and I turned to food as a comfort instead of as a fuel ( If you get stuck in that mental space then I will 
           bring that formula later in my blog). As you can see there, I had a big stack of pancakes. I ate like a runner, even when 
           I wasn't a runner and it caught up to me.</p>
        
       <p>It was hard to get out of that mental funk, when there was so much I felt like I couldn't do and that first mile made all the difference.
        
        Then in January that following year they thought that I had a heart issue because my EKG 'as abnormal. 
        
        I was at an all time low. I was not able to do ANY cardio activity and I was nervous as hell that something was wrong with my heart and 
        turns out after seeing a cardiologist that they gave me a clean bill of health</p>
        
        <p>Then I thought to myself
        
       <strong> "Whats my excuse?"</strong></p> 

        <p> So I trained hard and completed my first half marathon in spring of 2016. I did a second half in the fall that year. I was at the 
            finisher party for the IronMan Louisville and then was when I thought " This is my next big goal. This is what I was meant to do". 
            That was the start of my journey. Thank you for listening and I hope you will be here along with me as I continue my journey.</p>

        <p></p> Give him a friend, we forget the trees get lonely too. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first. Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. Mountains are so simple, they're hard. You create the dream - then you bring it into your world.</p>

        <p>You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important. Let your heart be your guide. I get carried away with this brush cleaning. There comes a nice little fluffer.</p>
        
        <p>You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. Let's build an almighty mountain. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way. We'll play with clouds today. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush. How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day.</p>
        
        <p>In your world you can create anything you desire. It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. All kinds of happy little splashes. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better.</p>
        
        <p>A big strong tree needs big strong roots. And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen. The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start. A beautiful little sunset. 
            If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them. Do an almighty painting with us.</p>
        
        <p>Just a little indication. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. Anyone can paint. Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world. A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play.</p>
        
        <p>You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun.</p>

    <h2 class= "race_day_tips"> How to put your best self forward on Race Day!! </h2>
    <div>
        <p> First off, you need to consider fueling strategies for up to three days prior to your event. The other piece is considering how much carbs, fat, protein, fiber, and hydration you are used to eating and what you need to eat. </p>
        
        <p>Based on my own experience, I know for a fact that the food you eat for a sprint look significantly different than that for a IronMan 70.3 for example:</p>
       
        <p> Perhaps you refer to the imminent attack of your Rebel fleet. Yes...I assure you we are quite safe from your friends here. Your overconfidence is your weakness. Your faith in your friends is yours. It is pointless to resist, my son. 
            Everything that has transpired has done so according to my design. Your friends up there on the Sanctuary Moon are walking into a trap. As is your Rebel fleet! It was I who allowed the Alliance to know the location of the shield generator. 
            
        <p>It is quite safe from your pitiful little band. An entire legion of my best troops awaits them. 
            Oh...I'm afraid the deflector shield will be quite operational when your friends arrive.</p>

        <p> Hey, you're not permitted in there. It's restricted. You'll be deactivated for sure.. Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease! Now come out before somebody sees you. Secret mission? What plans? What are you talking about? 
            I'm not getting in there! I'm going to regret this. There goes another one. Hold your fire. There are no life forms. It must have been short-circuited. That's funny, the damage doesn't look as bad from out here. Are you sure this things safe? </p>

            <p>You're safe! We had feared the worst. When we heard about Alderaan, we were afraid that you were... We don't have time for our sorrows, Commander. The battle station has surely tracked us here. It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape. 
                You must use the information in this R2 unit to plan the attack. It is our only hope. Yes. We are approaching the planet Yavin. The Rebel base is on a moon on the far side. We are preparing to orbit the planet.

                What is thy bidding, my master? There is a great disturbance in the Force. I have felt it. We have a new enemy - Luke Skywalker. Yes, my master. He could destroy us. He's just a boy. 
                Obi-Wan can no longer help him. The Force is strong with him. 
                The son of Skywalker must not become a Jedi. If he could be turned, he would become a powerful ally. Yes. Yes. He would be a great asset. Can it be done? He will join us or die, my master.</p>

                <p> I don't know where you get you delusions, laser brain.</p>
                
                <p> Bespin. It's pretty far, but I think we can make it. A mining colony? Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine. Lando conned somebody out of it. We go back a long way, Lando and me. Can you trust him? No. 
                But he has no love for the Empire, I can tell you that. Here we go, Chewie. Stand by. Detach! You do have your moments. Not many, but you have them.</p>
