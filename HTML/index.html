    <h1>Transformidable- <i>Advice for the everyday Triathlete</i></h1>
    <p>Hello world. This is a website for the underdog, the everyday person who is going from being a couch potato to a medal hog.
                I want to first be able to share with you my story and my fitness journey in progress. Then my training tips, and finally 
                my race reports that I have been able to complete, and my goals for this next year. Thanks for stopping by!
                </p>

    <p> And maybe, maybe, maybe... Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world. You can do anything your heart can imagine.</p>
                    
       <p> It's cold, but it's beautiful. Just make a decision and let it go. Now then, let's play. Let's have a happy little tree in here. Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun. </p>
        
       <p>All you need is a dream in your heart, and an almighty knife. Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect.</p> 
        
       <p>It's all a game of angles. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch. All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. In your world you can create anything you desire. Anything you want to do you can do here. Everybody needs a friend. </p>
